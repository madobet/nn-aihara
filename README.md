# nn-aihara

Exploring the brain network dynamics with Aihara chaotic neural network

## Usage

It was written in C/C++ and developed with CLion,
with TBB library for parallel and igraph library for complex network analysis.

## TODO

- Fix bugs and maybe a simple UI
- Port to Make or (totally) CMake
- Introduction of Aihara neural network
- Use OpenMP to replace TBB
